### CPSC 120

*       Lab 01 - "Introduction to Basics"
        Why It's a Favorite: I enjoyed this lab because it introduced the basics of C++ in a clear and structured way. The exercise "hello.cc" was simple yet effective in helping me understand programming syntax, file organization, and how to compile a program.
        What I Learned: This lab taught me the importance of keeping my files organized, writing clean code with proper headers, and using the clang++ compiler. It also emphasized how meaningful git log messages can make a big difference when working on collaborative projects.

        Lab 03 - "Advanced Constructs with Multiple Parts"
        Why It's a Favorite: I liked this lab because it focused on collaboration, which was clear from the requirement to complete the AUTHORS.md file. The exercises, such as calculating Basal Metabolic Rate ("bmr.cc") and finding date differences ("datediff.cc"), were practical and connected programming to real-world scenarios.
        What I Learned: I learned how to write and use functions to manipulate data for real applications, like calculating the difference between two dates. Managing Makefiles for building and testing the program was also a new and valuable skill I picked up.

        Lab 04 - "Functions and Problem Solving"
        Why It's a Favorite: This lab was one of my favorites because it was challenging and covered a lot of ground. Part 2, with the "hilo.cc" guessing game, made problem-solving really engaging, while Part 1 showed me how to use modular programming effectively.
        What I Learned: I learned how to break a program into smaller, reusable components using functions and headers, which made the code more organized. Writing unit tests and debugging my work gave me hands-on experience in making sure my code was reliable and worked as intended.
